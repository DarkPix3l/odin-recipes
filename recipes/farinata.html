         <p class="description">It is a very low savory pie with a golden crust, it is made with only 4 ingredients and has very ancient origins: we are talking about chickpea farinata, a Ligurian specialty typical especially of the city of Genoa. Made with a batter made from chickpea flour, water, olive oil and salt, it is traditionally cooked in a wood-fired oven but here we explain how to prepare it in your home oven! Although the procedure is very simple, it is necessary to follow some precautions for the success of the recipe, first of all the resting time, which is essential to completely hydrate the dried legumes. Secondly, it is important to choose the right pan and grease it generously, to prevent the farinata from sticking to the bottom. So good in its authenticity, chickpea farinata is a street food that can also be found under different names in other regions of Italy, including cecina, socca, fain√©... in Livorno for example it takes the name of 5 and 5 and is enjoyed inside a sandwich! Alternatively, it is excellent on its own or as an appetizer, accompanied with cheeses and cured meats. And you, how do you prefer it?</p>
